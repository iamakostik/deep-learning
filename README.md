# deep-learning
Welcome to HDSC Winter'22 premier project group \
This project is aimed at studying the dataset provided and practical application of data science in order to answer viable business questions. 
The objective is to predict the profitability of a company given certain variables. 

# The dataset
Dataset consists of following files: 
1. Prices.csv: raw, as-is daily prices. Most of data spans from 2010 to the end 2016, for companies new on stock market date range is shorter. There have been approx. 140 stock splits in that time, this set doesn't account for that 
2. Prices-split-adjusted.csv: same as prices, but there have been added adjustments for splits 
3. Securities.csv: general description of each company with division on sectors 
4. Fundamentals.csv: metrics extracted from annual SEC 10K fillings (2012-2016), should be enough to derive most of popular fundamental indicators.
